            <p>Lebanon (/ˈlɛbənɒn, -nən/ LEB-ə-non, -⁠nən; Arabic: لُبْنَان, romanized: Lubnān, local pronunciation: [lɪbˈneːn]), 
                officially the Republic of Lebanon, is a country in the Levant region of West Asia. It is bordered by Syria to the 
                north and east, by Israel to the south, and by the Mediterranean Sea to the west; Cyprus lies a short distance away 
                from the country's coastline. Lebanon's location at the crossroads of the Mediterranean Basin and the Arabian 
                hinterlands has contributed to the country's rich history and shaped a unique cultural identity shaped by religious diversity. Lebanon has a population of more than five million people and covers an area of 10,452 square kilometres (4,036 sq mi). Lebanon's capital and largest city is Beirut, followed by Tripoli and Jounieh. While Arabic is the official language, French is also recognized in a formal capacity; Lebanese Arabic is the country's vernacular, though French and English play a relatively significant role in everyday life, with Modern Standard Arabic being limited to news and government matters.</p>
