            <p>Rwanda, officially the Republic of Rwanda, is a landlocked country in the Great Rift Valley of Central Africa, where the 
                African Great Lakes region and Southeast Africa converge. Located a few degrees south of the Equator, Rwanda is 
                bordered by Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is highly elevated, giving it the 
                soubriquet "land of a thousand hills" (French: pays des mille collines), with its geography dominated by mountains in 
                the west and savanna to the southeast, with numerous lakes throughout the country. The climate is temperate to 
                subtropical, with two rainy seasons and two dry seasons each year. It is the most densely populated mainland African 
                country; among countries larger than 10,000 km2, it is the fifth most densely populated country in the world. Its 
                capital and largest city is Kigali.</p>
