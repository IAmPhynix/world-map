            <p>Colombia, officially the Republic of Colombia, is a country mostly in South America with insular regions in North 
                America. The Colombian mainland is bordered by the Caribbean Sea to the north, Venezuela to the east and northeast, 
                Brazil to the southeast, Ecuador and Peru to the south and southwest, the Pacific Ocean to the west, and Panama to the 
                northwest. Colombia is divided into 32 departments. The Capital District of Bogotá is also the country's largest city 
                hosting the main financial and cultural hub. Other major urbes include Medellín, Cali, Barranquilla, Cartagena, Santa 
                Marta, Cúcuta, Ibagué, Villavicencio and Bucaramanga. It covers an area of 1,141,748 square kilometers (440,831 sq mi) and has a population of around 52 million. Its rich cultural heritage—including language, religion, cuisine, and art—reflects its history as a colony, fusing cultural elements brought by immigration from Europe and the Middle East, with those brought by the African diaspora, as well as with those of the various Indigenous civilizations that predate colonization. Spanish is the official language, although Creole English and 64 other languages are recognized regionally.</p>
