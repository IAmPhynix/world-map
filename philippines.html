            <p>The Philippines, officially the Republic of the Philippines, is an archipelagic country in Southeast Asia. In the 
                western Pacific Ocean, it consists of 7,641 islands, with a total area of 300,000 square kilometers, which are broadly 
                categorized in three main geographical divisions from north to south: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The Philippines is 
                bounded by the South China Sea to the west, the Philippine Sea to the east, and the Celebes Sea to the south. It shares 
                maritime borders with Taiwan to the north, Japan to the northeast, Palau to the east and southeast, Indonesia to the 
                south, Malaysia to the southwest, Vietnam to the west, and China to the northwest. It is the world's twelfth-most-populous country, with diverse ethnicities and cultures. Manila is the country's capital, and its most populated city is Quezon City. Both are within Metro Manila.</p>
