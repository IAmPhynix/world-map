            <p>Sudan, officially the Republic of the Sudan, is a country in Northeast Africa. It borders the Central African Republic 
                to the southwest, Chad to the west, Egypt to the north, Eritrea to the northeast, Ethiopia to the southeast, Libya to 
                the northwest, South Sudan to the south, and the Red Sea. It has a population of 45.7 million people as of 2022 and 
                occupies 1,886,068 square kilometres (728,215 square miles), making it Africa's third-largest country by area and the 
                third-largest by area in the Arab League. It was the largest country by area in Africa and the Arab League until the 
                secession of South Sudan in 2011; since then both titles have been held by Algeria. Its capital and most populous city is Khartoum.</p>
