            <p>Greenland (Greenlandic: Kalaallit Nunaat, pronounced [kalaːɬːit nʉnaːt]; Danish: Grønland, pronounced [ˈkʁɶnˌlænˀ]) is 
                a North American autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark. It is the larger of two autonomous territories within 
                the Kingdom, the other being the Faroe Islands; the citizens of both territories are full citizens of Denmark. As 
                Greenland is one of the Overseas Countries and Territories of the European Union, citizens of Greenland are European 
                Union citizens. The capital and largest city of Greenland is Nuuk. Greenland lies between the Arctic and Atlantic 
                oceans, east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. It is the world's largest island,[d] and is the location of the 
                northernmost area of the world – Kaffeklubben Island off the northern coast is the world's northernmost undisputed point of land, and Cape Morris Jesup on the mainland was thought to be so until the 1960s.</p>
