            <p>Syria, officially the Syrian Arab Republic, is a country in West Asia located in the Eastern Mediterranean and the 
                Levant. It is bounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the west, Turkey to the north, Iraq to the east and southeast, 
                Jordan to the south, and Israel and Lebanon to the southwest. Cyprus lies to the west across the Mediterranean Sea. 
                It is a unitary republic that consists of 14 governorates (subdivisions). A country of fertile plains, high mountains, 
                and deserts, Syria is home to diverse ethnic and religious groups, including the majority Arabs, Kurds, Turkmens, 
                Assyrians, Circassians, Armenians, Albanians, Greeks, and Chechens. Religious groups include Muslims, Christians, 
                Alawites, Druze, and Yazidis. The capital and largest city is Damascus, followed by Aleppo, Homs, Latakia, Hama, 
                Deirezor, and Raqqa. Arabs are the largest ethnic group, and Sunni Muslims are the largest religious group. Syria is 
                now the only country that is governed by Ba'athists, who advocate Arab socialism and Arab nationalism.</p>
