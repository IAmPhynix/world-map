            <p>Nepal, officially the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, is a landlocked country in South Asia. It is mainly 
                situated in the Himalayas, but also includes parts of the Indo-Gangetic Plain. It borders the Tibet Autonomous 
                Region of China to the north, and India to the south, east, and west, while it is narrowly separated from Bangladesh 
                by the Siliguri Corridor, and from Bhutan by the Indian state of Sikkim. Nepal has a diverse geography, including fertile plains, subalpine forested hills, and eight of the world's ten tallest mountains, including Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth. Kathmandu is the nation's capital and the largest city. Nepal is a multi-ethnic, multi-lingual, multi-religious and multi-cultural state, with Nepali as the official language.</p>
