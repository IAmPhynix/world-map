            <p>Oman, officially the Sultanate of Oman, is a country located in West Asia. It is situated on the southeastern coast of 
                the Arabian Peninsula, and spans the mouth of the Persian Gulf. It shares land borders with Saudi Arabia, United Arab 
                Emirates, and Yemen, while sharing maritime borders with Iran and Pakistan. The capital and largest city is Muscat. 
                Oman has a population of nearly 4.7 million and is ranked the 124th most-populous country. The coast is formed by the 
                Arabian Sea on the southeast, and the Gulf of Oman on the northeast. The Madha and Musandam exclaves are surrounded by 
                United Arab Emirates on their land borders, with the Strait of Hormuz (which it shares with Iran) and the Gulf of Oman forming Musandam's coastal boundaries.</p>
