            <p>Turkey, officially the Republic of Türkiye, is a country mainly in Anatolia in West Asia, with a smaller part called 
                East Thrace in Southeast Europe. It borders the Black Sea to the north; Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Iran to 
                the east; Iraq, Syria, and the Mediterranean Sea (and Cyprus) to the south; and the Aegean Sea, Greece, and Bulgaria 
                to the west. Turkey is home to over 85 million people; most are ethnic Turks, while ethnic Kurds are the largest ethnic 
                minority. Officially a secular state, Turkey has a Muslim-majority population. Ankara is Turkey's capital and 
                second-largest city; Istanbul is its largest city, and its economic and financial center, as well as the largest 
                city in Europe. Other major cities include İzmir, Bursa, Antalya, Konya and Adana.</p>
